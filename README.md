# 🧑‍💼 IBM HR Analytics – Employee Attrition Analysis

This project explores the pressing challenge of employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset. By understanding what drives employees to leave, we aim to uncover actionable insights that can help companies improve retention and reduce turnover-related costs.

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Understand Current Turnover Rates**
   - Analyze the demographic distribution of attrition by age, gender, education, department, and job role.

2. **Identify Key Factors Influencing Turnover**

   - Explore financial metrics (monthly income, salary hike)
   - Evaluate benefit factors (stock options, environment)
